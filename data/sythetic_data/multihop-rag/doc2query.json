Quick backstory: Yahoo inked a deal with Mozilla way back in 2014 to pay the browser maker $375 million annually to be the default search engine on Firefox. At the time, Google was offering $276 million, said Baker. Reader, that was a bad deal.

Before we go into some of these tidbits\u2026\n\nWhy the Google vs. U.S. antitrust case matters\n\nThe government has argued that Google uses its platforms and deals with partners to block out any competition in search or advertising, thus hindering competitors from accessing the data they\u2019d need to improve their products. If Judge Amit Mehta rules against Google, the search giant may have to change its behavior and share its APIs with third-party developers. It may also be banned from making anticompetitive and exclusive deals with smartphone and computer manufacturers and wireless carriers. Google might end up having to turn over all or most of the data it has collected to other search engines so they can improve their products and attract more users. The DOJ has said that Google gets 16 times more data than Bing does everyday. Enforcers want to show that antitrust law remains relevant and that even though Google is basically the God of the internet, it\u2019s still no match for the U.S. law. The Google outcome could also have a ripple effect on other Big Tech cases. The FTC sued Amazon in September for using anticompetitive and unfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power. The DOJ has been investigating Apple for years over the company\u2019s policy for third-party apps on its devices and whether it unfairly favors its own products. There\u2019s an ongoing case between the FTC and Facebook, wherein the agency calls on Facebook to sell Instagram and WhatsApp."], "doc": "More from the US v Google trial: vertical search, pre-installs and the case of Firefox/Yahoo", "event": "The government has argued that Google uses its platforms and deals with partners to block out any competition in search or advertising."}, {"query": "How do the various classes and subclasses in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 influence gameplay and character development?", "evidence_list": ["Your class mostly determines how your character will fight in Baldur\u2019s Gate, but with 12 classes \u2014 and 46 subclasses total across them all \u2014 it\u2019s not really an easy decision."], "doc": "How to choose the best class for you in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3", "event": "Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 offers 12 classes and 46 subclasses for players to choose from."}, {"query": "In what ways do the Ability Scores affect a character's performance in both combat and non-combat situations in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3?", "evidence_list": ["Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 assigns your Ability Scores automatically (though you can tweak it in the character creator), so each class\u2019s primary ability will be your highest score."], "doc": "How to choose the best class for you in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3", "event": "Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 assigns Ability Scores automatically, which can be tweaked in the character creator."}, {"query": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of choosing an Origin character compared to creating a custom character in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3?", "evidence_list": ["Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 gives you the option to play as an Origin character, meaning you can just choose one of the NPCs from your party and play as them right out of the gate.

Lawrence is a decent starter but I'd rather roll with Anthony Richardson, Jordan Love and Justin Fields.", "LAST WEEK: Can't blame drops this time. With his top receiver blanketed thanks to a heavy dose of man coverage, and with a favorable game script, Lawrence didn't have to do too much to help the Jaguars roll past the Falcons. His TD throw off-schedule to Ridley was awesome, but Lawrence set season-lows in pass attempts (30) and throws of 10-plus Air Yards (20% rate). It's worth noting that Week 4 was the first time all year a defense chose to play significant man coverage snaps against the Jaguars.", "THIRD DOWNS: Stunningly, Lawrence has completed just 50% of his throws here; only Geno Smith has a worse rate among qualifying quarterbacks. Lawrence is averaging 4.4 yards per attempt with a 6.9-yard Average Depth of Target (ADOT) on the money downs, both ranking bottom-six in the league. Only one pass has been dropped on third down. It's been a drain on his Fantasy production.", "PRESSURE: Lawrence is neither getting good pass protection nor thriving while under pressure. Statistically he's a mix of average and bad with his 45.7% completion rate, 6.7 yards per attempt and 14.3% off-target rate when defenders get near him. But the worst number is his EPA per dropback of minus-0.72; only Jimmy Garoppolo, Deshaun Watson and Ryan Tannehill are worse there. That means he's hurting his team more than helping when pressured.

For now he's among the TD-needy running back tier who might only give 13 or 14 PPR points even if he does score (which no one has done against Atlanta). He's more than fine as a bye-week replacement RB (or a RB who you kind of have to start because you're thin at the position) but I'd prefer Breece Hall, Isiah Pacheco and Rhamondre Stevenson over Pierce.", "LAST WEEK: Had a touchdown called back on a short designed screen and two more runs from 10 yards or closer get blown up.

He also did an admirable job fighting for extra yards play after play.

On the season he's been a full yard worse on outside runs and about the same on inside runs, so perhaps he and the Texans are improving on those edge plays.", "FALCONS: Have run hot and cold against the run but they've ultimately been good by virtue of their 3.8 rushing average and zero rushing touchdowns allowed to running backs this season.
